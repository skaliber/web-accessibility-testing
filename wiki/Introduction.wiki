= Introduction =

I created this project to help us to detect potential usability and accessibility issues not covered by static analysis tools such as Bobby, [http://www.sidar.org/hera/index.php.en Hera 
] etc. The goal is to use test automation to help detect and investigate potential usability and accessibility issues. The project's started with Keyboard helper tests e.g. to detect issues with 'Tabbing' through web pages. There's lots more work planned and I'd welcome your contributions if you're interested in getting involved.

= Getting started =
So, at the moment I'm assuming you're willing to dig in and download other code, given the early nature of the current codebase that seems appropriate :) I've added a brief readme.txt in the docs folder of the project, http://code.google.com/p/web-accessibility-testing/source/browse/trunk/docs/readme.txt which may help to get you underway. 

I aim to reduce the burden of using the project as the code matures. Add your comments to this page for now to encourage me that it's worth prioritising this work.

Thanks
