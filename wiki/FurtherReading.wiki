||URL||Description||
||http://openajax-dev.jongund.webfactional.com/||One of the projects which inspired us to add the tests of the web content (compared to the original work to test web behaviour). Well worth investing some time to understand their work and approach.|| 
||http://test.cita.illinois.edu/||Lots of useful material to help with testing and understanding WCAG, ARIA, etc.||
||http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/||The definitive reference for Web Accessibility and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)||
||http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/||The definitive reference for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, currently version 2.0||
||http://www.weba11y.com/blog/2009/07/02/more-fun-with-the-tabindex-attribute/||Lots of details on using tabindexes and how tabindex is handled by various desktop web browsers. This material may help with cross-browser issues and with designing our test material. The site includes a couple of example pages.||
