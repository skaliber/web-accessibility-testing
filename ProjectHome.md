This project helps to detect possible problems related to accessibility and usability of web applications. Currently the code relies on webdriver http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/ which includes support for 'native' keyboard events, which we use to test relatively accurately how web sites and web applications behave to user input, etc.

The project is young and will be extended and enhanced as we discover, and implement, practical heuristics :)

In July 2011 we added a new codebase that helps detect many of the WCAG guidelines. We intend to restructure the earlier code to make it more consistent and compatible with the newer code. Thank you to eBay for giving us permission to opensource the new codebase.
